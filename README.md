# Income Tax Queries ChatBot
The repository contains a project consisting of a chatbot which helps you in your income tax queries and helps you choose relevant ITR forms, and other details.

The code contains a intent.json file which contains the data of the patterns and their responses which the model takes and processes


The maincode file contains the implementation of the model, data preprocessing and then training of the model to predict responses.

The project is being modified to answer more queries in future and eventually calculate your tax liabilities based on your income and deductions
